# Go-Gotchas

## Some gotchas, from Golang, to shorten your learning curve

A repository for snippets I've posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GolangAtSpeed) and sometimes [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/GolangAtSpeed/). All are in the Go Playground for you to experiment with.

## Why?

I'm Ollie, I'm based in the UK and I offer Go Training, on-site with you, or 
fully hosted off-site. I love coding in Golang (I've worked in Fintech and Healthtech for lots of years), and I want to help others get there a bit quicker than I did - Go is simple, until it's not :)

Check out the [GolangatSpeed website](https://golangatspeed.com) or, get in touch for more information --> Training@GolangAtSpeed.com

## There are no answers here, only questions ;)

For now organised in chronological order.
