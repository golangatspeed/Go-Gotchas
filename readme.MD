# Go-Gotchas

## Some gotchas, from Golang, to shorten your learning curve

A repository for snippets I've posted on Twitter and sometimes Linkedin. 
All are in the Go Playground to experiment with.

## Why?

I'm Ollie, I'm based in the UK and I offer Go Training. On-site with you, or 
fully hosted off-site. I love coding in Golang and helping others get there a bit
quicker than I did. I started coding in Golang over 5 years ago - and I never
looked back!

## There are no answers, only questions ;)

For now organised in chronological order.
